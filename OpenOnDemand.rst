Open OnDemand
##############

Open OnDemand (OOD) is a way for users to access to their HPC resources via a web interface for the Rockfish cluster. It is a web-portal that provides a shell, file browser, and graphical interface for applications such as IGV, Matlab, ParaView, Jupyter and RStudio Server, etc.

A Rockfish account is necessary to use OOD. Also, a campus network connection or VPN is not required to access the OOD portal.
