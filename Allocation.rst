Computing Allocations
*********************

**Who can request allocation**
  * 40 Research groups that participated in the MRI proposal
  * Condo users
  * Deans’ approved research groups (TBD)
  * Morgan State Users
  * XSEDE users via a proposal

**Allocation Type**

#. **MRI-related allocations**: PIs who participated in the proposal to NSF should submit a short proposal justifying the request for cpu-cycles and storage.
#. **Regular cpu-cycles**: This is the standard allocation. Maximum allocation 750,000 core hours per quarter.
#. **LM allocations**: This allocation will allow users to submit jobs to the “large memory” nodes. Maximum allocation per quarter 50,000 core-hours.
#. **GPU allocation**: This allocation will allow users to submit jobs to the GPU nodes. Maximum allocation is 50,000 core hours.
#. **Startup/Trial allocations**: PIs can request a one-time only startup allocation to gain access to try Rockfish resources. Users will be able to quickly (i) run small scale jobs or activities to familiarize with the new environment and (ii) benchmark and evaluate different resources and collected data to support their proposals for allocations. The allocation time limit is 50,000 core-hours for one quarter. No proposal is needed. Please send an email to the rockfish help system for approval and then use the rockfish `portal`_ to request an allocation and accounts.

**Condo-related allocations**

#. PIs who contribute condos will have an allocation (or additional allocation) equivalent to the size of the condo. For example a one node condo is equivalent to 100,000 core-hours per quarter.
#. Condo storage and purchased storage: This allocation is composed of the storage given by default plus the size of the storage purchased. It may cover different file sets.
#. Morgan State University allocations: A subset of allocations will follow a model developed at Morgan State University as a partner for this grant.
#. Deans’ allocations: The Dean’s office will offer small/startup faculty members allocations. These allocations WILL follow the MRI-topics and will be part of the annual report to the funding agency.
#. New faculty members will have allocations equivalent to the size of the condo in their LOI, or as offered by the Dean’s office.
#. XSEDE allocations will follow the process established for XSEDE allocations (XRAC).
