Parallel Computing Jobs
***********************

The simplest way to do work in parallel is to run many jobs independently at a time. However, to perform many operations coherently and concurrently on multiple CPUs in one or multiple nodes, an application needs to be programmed with a parallel model and compiled by certain libraries. For HPC software, there are three basic parallel models: Shared Memory, Distributed Memory and Hybrid Model are usually used.

Shared Memory with Threads

It performs any serial work, and then creates a number of threads running by CPU (or GPU) cores concurrently.
Each thread can have local data, but also, shares the entire resources, including RAM memory of the main program.
Threads communicate with each other through global memory (RAM). *
Threads can come and go, but the main program remains present to provide the necessary shared resources until the application has completed.

.. sidebar:: Note
  * This requires synchronization operations to ensure that no more than one thread is updating the same RAM address at any time.
